  - ** Known Issues **
    - If the 2 piece bonus for tier 7 cannot be inferred from the log(gear information may be missing), you may get incorrect values for rip ticks and damage. IE: it may show that you missed rip ticks when you did not, etc.
    - Warnings / alerts (yellow, red colors on the left hand side of casts) have not yet been updated to reflect data that is meaningful to feral druids.
    - Some information shown on casts has not been tailored to feral druids yet such as cast time or delay.
